Description: 3 will be given a very large list of AWS EC2 instances and (probably) some incomplete code to load and/or parse through the file.
For this exercise, we are going to make a console-based application where a user can enter their minimum required CPU cores (and, optionally, a maximum) 
and their minimum required memory in GiB (and, optionally, a maximum),
and then display to the user a list of all AWS EC2 instance types that support their needs.
In this simulation, the user will request cloud resources and your program will determine if the requested resources are available
based on some limit that is defined.
